            <h3>Healthy Diet</h3>
            <p>
                Eating a healthy diet is not about strict limitations, 
                staying unrealistically thin, 
                or depriving yourself of the foods you love. 
                Rather, its about feeling great, having more energy, 
                improving your health, and boosting your mood.
